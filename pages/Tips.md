1. Be clear and concise, but this doesn't mean your prose can't be fun (McCloskey, Chpt 4).
2. Begin writing early in a project, use writing as thinking  (McCloskey, Chpt 8).
3. Write for the intended audience. Who is your audience? What do they already know? What do they value?  (McCloskey, Chpt 11).
4. Limit repetition and predictable passages, e.g., nobody needs the paragraph: " The paper proceeds as follows...." (McCloskey, Chpt 12).
5. Each paragraph should contain one important point, or should be "a complete discussion of one topic (McCloskey 2000, 44)." Paragraphs can and should vary in lengths to change the pace (McCloskey, Chpt 14; Fowler Chpt 6).
6. Table and Figures should be self-explanatory. Readers might skim your paper and need be to able to take away the most important points. This also means the captions need to contain a concise explanation. (McCloskey, Chpt 15, Imai 2013).
7. Your writing should be coheren. Sentences should work and fit together (McCloskey, Chpt 17).
8. Read! You should read other people's writing. By reading good writing you will become a better writer yourself (Fowler, Chapt 2).
9. Read your own work out loud. Your ear will tell you what does and does not sound good (McCloskey, Chpts 18, 24).
